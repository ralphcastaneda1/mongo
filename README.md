Exploring semi‐structured JSON with MongoDB on the Yelp Academic Dataset

MongoDB & Semi-Structured JSON


## Overview

In this project, you’ll investigate how MongoDB—a document-oriented NoSQL datastore—handles semi-structured JSON compared to a traditional relational model. We’ll use the **Yelp Academic Dataset**, focusing on:

- **businesses** (full dataset)  
- **reviews** (first 7 500 entries)  
- **users** (first 1 000 entries)  

By the end, you should understand MongoDB’s document model, indexing, and query capabilities, and be able to compare them to SQL approaches.

## Dataset

1. `businesses.json` — all business documents  
2. `reviews.json`    — first 7 500 review documents  
3. `users.json`      — first 1 000 user documents

Each document is a JSON object matching the Yelp schema. Files are located in `data/`.
